# Shocovox - Shady Octree Of Voxels with Ray Marching
Shocovox is a Sparse Voxel Octree implementation in GPU Shader Language(s) ( hence: shady ).
A basic implementation for raytracing is available with GPU support!

The library uses Left handed Y up coordinate system.

Roadmap: 
-
- Implementing Caching to request data on demand to handle large data: https://github.com/davids91/shocovox/milestone/3
- Displaying large data as a panorama: https://github.com/davids91/shocovox/milestone/1
- Finalising "Octree of Voxel Bricks" concept: https://github.com/davids91/shocovox/milestone/2

Special thanks to contributors and supporters!
